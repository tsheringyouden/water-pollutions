        <p>my company name is water pollution</p>

        🧪 Common Causes
Industrial Discharges: Factories release toxic chemicals and heavy metals into water bodies.
Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste wash into streams and rivers.
Urbanization: Stormwater carries trash, oil, and chemicals from cities into waterways.
Improper Waste Disposal: Dumping plastics, pharmaceuticals, and household waste pollutes water.
Oil Spills: Accidental leaks from ships or drilling operations severely damage marine ecosystems3.

🐠 Effects on the Environment
Aquatic Life: Pollutants can kill fish, disrupt food chains, and destroy habitats.
Eutrophication: Excess nutrients cause algal blooms that deplete oxygen and suffocate marine life.
Human Health: Contaminated water can spread diseases and toxins, affecting millions globally.
